                I worked as a web designer for approximately two years at PreeDex Softwares LLP, where I developed over 100 websites. My role involved understanding client requirements and creating websites for them accordingly. 

                During this time, I created numerous websites using drag-and-drop platforms such as Wix Classic, EditorX, Webflow, and Shopify. I specialize in developing websites that are fully responsive, ADA compliant, SEO optimized, and visually appealing.
